# Glorious Cargonia
A mod inspired by the cult classic game from 2004 that still is somehow still recieving updates: Space Station 13
This mod attempts to add various blocks that represent the machinery available to players in SS13, with a particular focus on Cargo containers and elements of the Cargo department's gameplay loop.
However, instead of using a cargo shuttle, for the sake of server sanity this mod uses teleporters to teleport goods to and from Central Command 
(Also known as "CentComm" by players of SS13).

#Planned Features
-- Autolathe for unique, mod-specific crafting to prevent recipie conflicts (hopefully will have KubeJS support for custom recipies. REI/JEI integration are planned.)
-- Plasma, Uranium, and Titanium ores to mine
-- Generators that run on Plasma, Uranium, or Diamond (Originally called PACMAN generators in the source material but the name will be changed, something simple like "Matter Burner")
-- Various alloys available through Autolathe
-- Cargo console with ability to be linked to teleporters
-- Export prices (With some way to add/adjust export prices for other items, via KubeJS or otherwise)
-- Crates of supplies that can be bought (medical supplies, potions, PPSH, Mosin Nagant, etc.)
  It is planned that certain crates such as potions will be gated behind exporting a certain number of a specific block or item. An example would be gating potions behind exports of blaze rods and nether wart.
-- Stock parts that can be hotswapped out of machines and upgraded using a Rapid Part Exchange Device (RPED).
-- Laser guns and charging stations for them that run on RF
-- Lavaland, a high-risk high-reward mining dimension that has very dangerous mobs and dungeons (maybe bosses down the line)
-- Explorer's armor, Cargo Tech/Quartermaster uniforms, Banners that can be waved to heal nearby players if you are wearing a full set, with the strength and cooldown depending on the set that you are wearing.
-- The Mosin Nagant and PPSH, (planned to be fully 3D modeled) weapons that can be reloaded by putting the gun in your off hand and right-clicking with a magazine in your main hand. Magazines with the same number of bullets left in them are planned to be able to stack in the inventory so you don't wind up juggling a billion clips. (I mean, that's how the source material handles it, but for the sake of player sanity I am going to add a bit of modern game design into the mix).
-- Ability to unload bullets from a magazine for storing in an armament box
-- Armament boxes for fast refilling of magazines and mass storage of spare bullets. All you have to do is shift-right click to throw all acceptable ammo from your inventory into the box, and right-click with a magazine in your off hand to fill the mag with bullets from your armament box.


#Potential Features that may or may not happen
-- Modular suits inspired by Dead Space and MachineMuse's modular powersuits
-- Rideable disposal pipes
-- Supermatter engine that runs on gasses that change temperature (This one in particular will be very difficult and is the most likely to be delayed, if released at all)
-- Walls and the tool interactions with them from SS13
  
  
-- Secession from Central Command as a final end-goal.
